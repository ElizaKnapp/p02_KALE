## Description 
We will be creating a minesweeper game with a community leaderboard for each difficulty of minesweeper board. Users will be able to play a minesweeper game on easy/medium/hard level without logging in, but are able to see the leaderboard for that board (level), based on time (less time = higher on the leaderboard). The user can log their score on the leaderboard by logging in (or creating an account). The leaderboard will be updating while other people are playing. Users who are logged in can create their own boards and anyone (logged in or not) can search for those boards by the user who created them (more detailed info on the leaderboard below).
